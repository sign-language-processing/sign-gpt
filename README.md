# SignGPT

Multi Task GPT model for Sign Language Processing, using spoken language text.

## Tokenization

- Spoken language text is tokenized using a BPE tokenizer.
- Poses are tokenized using the [MediaPipe vector quantizer](https://github.com/sign-language-processing/sign-vq).
- SignWriting is tokenized using the
  [SignWriting Tokenizer](https://github.com/sign-language-processing/signwriting/blob/main/signwriting/tokenizer/signwriting_tokenizer.py).
- HamNoSys (if used) is tokenized using a character level tokenizer.

## Tasks

This GPT model is designed to be large, and encode a wide variety of tasks in Sign Language Processing.
The tasks we currently cover are
