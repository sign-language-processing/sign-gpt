# Language Utils

For the instructions, we want to use language names, such as "English", not "en".

Therefore, we download the following files:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sign/i18n/main/build/languages/en.json -O languages.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sign/i18n/main/build/countries/en.json -O countries.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sign/i18n/main/build/signedLanguages/en.json -O signed_languages.json
```
